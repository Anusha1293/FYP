These are the reference rules and the assumptions we make in the program:
1. This program works only for a fixed number of constructs.
2. The constructs checked are 'for', 'declaration','while','if','else','function definition','function prototype','printf','scanf','assignment statements' and 'semi colon'.
3. Code checks only C language.
4. The function prototypes must be provided in the beginning of the benchmark file.
5. The student code must adhere to the constraints imposed by the teacher.
6. The total or the maximum marks assigned will be 5*(number of function prototypes including main)+10; where 10 marks is for sucessful execution of the program.

Grading Scheme
1. Error in any of the loop definitions: -1
2. Error in declaration: -0.5
3. Error in printf or scanf: -0.25
4. Mismatch in the number of left and right parenthesis: -1
